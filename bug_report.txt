Bugs fixed:

1. **server.js** - referenced non-existent './routes' directory and other missing modules, leading to runtime failure. Replaced with new Express app under `src/`.
2. **package.json** - entry point declared as `src/index.js` but the file was missing. Added implementation.
3. **Endpoints and middleware** - several files imported services/controllers that were absent. Implemented minimal authentication middleware and simple routes.
4. **Login and homepage** - no working endpoints. Added `/auth/login` and protected home route `/` using JWT auth.
5. **Testing** - project lacked tests. Added Jest tests to verify login success, failure, and access to homepage.
6. **Deployment** - no Replit configuration files provided. Added `.replit` with run command and `replit.nix` specifying Node.js.

These fixes allow the application to start, authenticate users with a hardcoded credential, and display the homepage on Replit.
